# Project Overview

This project is a frontend application using Vite and likely React (based on the presence of `main.tsx` and `App.tsx`).

## Main Entry Points

-   **HTML Entry**: [index.html](mdc:index.html) is the main HTML file.
-   **JavaScript/TypeScript Entry**: [src/main.tsx](mdc:src/main.tsx) is the TypeScript/React entry point for the application.
-   **Root Component**: [src/App.tsx](mdc:src/App.tsx) is likely the root component of the application.

## Top-Level Directory Structure

-   `public/`: Stores static assets that are directly copied to the build output directory.
-   `src/`: Contains all the source code for the application.
    -   `src/api/`: For API requests and response handling.
    -   `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components.
    -   `src/pages/`: Contains the various pages or views of the application.
    -   `src/hooks/`: Stores custom React Hooks.
    -   `src/services/`: May contain business logic services.
    -   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
    -   `src/utils/`: General utility functions.
    -   `src/constants/`: Constants used in the application.
-   `.github/`: GitHub-related configurations, such as workflows.
-   `.vscode/`: VS Code editor-specific configurations.
