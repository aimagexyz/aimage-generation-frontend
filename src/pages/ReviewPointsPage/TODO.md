# ReviewPointsPage - TODO Actions

## âœ… COMPLETED (KISS & DRY Refactoring)

### 1. âœ… Extract Custom Hooks

- [x] `useViewState.ts` - State management for view controls
- [x] `useRPDFiltering.ts` - Data filtering and sorting logic
- [x] `useBulkOperations.ts` - Bulk selection and operations
- [x] `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` - Keyboard shortcut handling

### 2. âœ… Extract UI Components

- [x] `PageHeader.tsx` - Page title and main actions
- [x] `SearchAndFilters.tsx` - Search input and filter controls
- [x] `LoadingAndErrorStates.tsx` - Loading skeletons and error displays
- [x] `EmptyState.tsx` - Empty state messaging
- [x] `DetailPanelPlaceholder.tsx` - RPD selection placeholder

### 3. âœ… Code Quality Improvements

- [x] Reduced main component from 772 to ~334 lines (57% reduction)
- [x] Eliminated duplicate logic and repetitive patterns
- [x] Improved separation of concerns
- [x] Enhanced code readability and maintainability
- [x] Maintained all existing functionality and accessibility features

## ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS (Future Improvements)

### 1. Testing & Quality

- [ ] Add unit tests for each custom hook
- [ ] Add component tests for extracted UI components
- [ ] Add integration tests for the main page flow
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting

### 2. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Add `React.memo` to appropriate components
- [ ] Implement virtualization for large RPD lists
- [ ] Add debouncing to search input
- [ ] Optimize re-rendering with better dependency arrays

### 3. Developer Experience

- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all exported functions
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for extracted components
- [ ] Add TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries

### 4. User Experience

- [ ] Add loading states for bulk operations
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for status changes
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation for RPD list
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness

### 5. Accessibility

- [ ] Add comprehensive ARIA labels
- [ ] Implement focus management
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements for state changes
- [ ] Test with accessibility tools

### 6. Internationalization

- [ ] Extract all hardcoded strings to translation files
- [ ] Support RTL languages
- [ ] Add locale-aware date formatting
- [ ] Implement language switching

### 7. Advanced Features

- [ ] Add drag-and-drop reordering
- [ ] Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Add advanced filtering options
- [ ] Create saved filter presets

## ðŸ“‹ TECHNICAL DEBT ITEMS

### 1. Type Safety

- [ ] Replace `any` types with proper interfaces
- [ ] Add strict TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Implement runtime type validation
- [ ] Add proper error type definitions

### 2. Code Standards

- [ ] Implement consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- [ ] Set up automated code review rules
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns

### 3. Architecture

- [ ] Consider implementing a state machine for complex flows
- [ ] Add proper data fetching error recovery
- [ ] Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Consider moving to a more structured state management solution
